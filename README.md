# Grafana Faro Demo App
This is a simple demo application created for the Grafana Emerging Champions Mentorship Program.  
The goal of this project is to learn how to instrument a web application using the **Grafana Faro Web SDK**.

## 🚀 Purpose

This demo app is intentionally minimal. It contains a single HTML file (`index.html`) with basic user interactions.  
During the mentorship session, we will:

- Add the Grafana Faro SDK to the page  
- Configure the collector URL  
- Trigger events (page loads, button clicks, alerts)  
- Verify that the data appears in Grafana Cloud  
- Explore how front-end instrumentation works

## 🖥️ Running the App Locally
